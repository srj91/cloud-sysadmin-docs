1) Prepare AWS Linux Box with the following.
	a) Create one Sudo user.
		#useradd username
		#passwd username

		#vi /etc/sudoers

		Add the below line

		username	ALL(ALL=ALL)	ALL

	b) Enable SSH with Password Authentication
		Modify the below file for authencate with password

		#vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

		PasswordAuthentication yes

2) Move the AWS Image to S3 Bucket
3) Download moved AWS Image (VHD) to your onprem

4) Convert downloaded VHD to Fixed VHD as it will be in dynamic VHD.

5) Create Hyper-V machine with converted VHD and boot it in Hyper-V.

6) Login to created Hyper-V machine with console and verify the IP Address to connect from SSH client app (Putty).

7) Prepare the Hyper-V machine for Azure by performing the following.

	a) #cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.bak
	b) #sed -i 's/[a-z][a-z].archive.ubuntu.com/azure.archive.ubuntu.com/g' /etc/apt/sources.list
	c) #apt-get update
	d) #apt-get install linux-generic-hwe-16.04 linux-cloud-tools-generic-hwe-16.04
	e) #reboot

8) Once you rebooted successfully after installing above generic kernel for azure, remove AWS kernel package from machine by following.

	a) #uname -r (this is let you know the current kernel version you have booted, if your kernel version is not generic then perform the following )
	b) #apt-cache search kernel | grep (copy paste uname -r value here)
	c) #apt-get remove Kernel-version-image and header

9) Change Grub Value to receive logs and Serial console access on Azure.

	#vi /etc/default/grub

	Change the following line.

	#update-grub

10) Finally install WALinuxAgnet in Hyper-V machine for Azure.

	#apt-get install walinuxagent
	#systemctl enable walinuxagent


11) Upload the prepared VHD to Azure and create a machine out of uploaded VHD.
