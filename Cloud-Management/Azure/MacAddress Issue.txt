========= Not able to connect to VM after creating VM from snapshot ===========

Issue:
Not able to connect to VM after creating VM from snapshot

OS:- Ubuntu 18.04 Canonical

Observation:
WAAgent Status: not ready
EnableVMaccess Extension: unavailable
walinuxagent service:- Up and running
waagent version:- WALinuxAgent-2.2.40
Serial Console: Accessible
External connectivity: Error:Network timeout
ping 8.8.8.8:- Network unreachable

Troubleshooting:
# systemctl status walinuxagent ---------- Running
# systemctl status cloud-init ----------------- Failed

Checked file /etc/resolv.conf ------------------ internal DNS nameserver (search) entry is missing 
## Should be having following three entries
nameserver 127.0.0.53
options edns0
search ve3ke0rfwgsejjyw5rf13ryezf.rx.internal.cloudapp.net

Isolation:
basically VM network connectivity is not available due to which external access is not available. This can occure if the MAC address in /etc	/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml file does not match with, MAC address of NIC associated with VM created

Resolution:
copied the MAC address from VM --> NIC --> Properties and placed in /etc/50-cloud-init.yaml file
Rebooted the VM.

installed the waagent with latest version with
# apt-get install walinuxagent
check version    
# waagent --version
